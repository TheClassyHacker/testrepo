# Backend Engineering + Cybersecurity: A Powerful Combo

## About This Repository

This is a test repository to showcase my use of **Markdown** and share insights on why learning **Backend Engineering** strengthens my **Cybersecurity** skills.

## Why Markdown Matters

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes documentation clean, readable, and easy to format. It’s widely used across:

- GitHub repos
- Technical documentation
- Knowledge bases
- Internal wikis

Knowing Markdown is essential for effective communication as an engineer or security professional — clear documentation reduces errors and keeps teams aligned.

## Backend Engineering & Cybersecurity: The Connection

### 1. Understanding Web Application Architecture
Backend engineering teaches how apps work from **end to end**. Knowing how data flows between the frontend, backend, and database helps identify where **vulnerabilities** can hide.

### 2. Secure Code Practices
When you write backend code, you learn how **input validation**, **authentication**, and **encryption** should be handled — all crucial to **secure development**.

### 3. Attack Surface Awareness
Backend systems expose APIs, manage databases, and handle sensitive logic. Learning backend engineering helps me understand **where attackers might strike**, which is key to proactive defense.

### 4. Real-World Threat Modeling
With backend knowledge, I can better apply **threat modeling** to identify risks like **SQL injection**, **insecure APIs**, or **poor session handling**.
